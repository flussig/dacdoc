# What is DacDoc
TL;DR 

DacDoc is the approach to keep technical documentation resilient to future changes by treating it as a code: keeping it in git repo and providing tests to some parts that can change in future.

# More documentation
Main part of the documentation is now moved to dedicated [page](https://flussig.github.io/dacdoc).
